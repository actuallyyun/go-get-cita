# What it does
It helps you to get an appointment when it is difficult to get one. I came up with this solution while trying to get an appointment with 
the Spanish police website, cita previa. It can work with any appointment websites that require you to fill up loads of information in
many steps, you will just have to change the link. I will explain in the instruction section.

If you are just looking for getting an appointment for the initial issuing of a Spanish TIE, please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/gavin-hutchinson/cita-previa-bot)

# How it works
This is the easiest and fastest way I can think of. First use ```Selenium```, the automated testing tool, to record the process,and export the code as a ```.py```file. Based on the generated code, you will have to manually make some modifications. Not many, but you will likely have to. Unfortunatelly, the
code generated by Selenium is often not perfect. 

# Prequisitions
Tools you will need to have are included in the requirements.txt file. 
- [ ] Selenium
- [ ] ChromeDriver

If you don't already have it, run

``` 
pip install chromedriver-py selenium

```

I assume you already have a code editor, Python and Chrome installed.

# Step by step instructions

1. Pull this repo to your local machine. ```git pull https://github.com/actuallyyun/go-get-cita-previa main```.
2. Open the ```test_demo.py``` file, this was generated by selenium IDE and modified by me. You can find my modifications by locating the comments.
3. Install the Chrome extension ```Selenium IDE```.
4. Start Selenium IDE, follow the instructions to generate your appoitment data. Export the file and save it in ```/GoGetCita```directory so the  ```getcita.py``` file can access it.
5. Let's modify the auto generated file. Add this to the end of the file:
```

        # If no cita, driver quits and starts again
        if "En este momento no hay citas disponibles." in self.driver.page_source:

            self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "btnSubmit").click()
            self.driver.close()

        # If there is cita, driver waits
        else:
            time.sleep(6000)
```
Often when you have to scroll down a page to see the button, Selenium fails to record this behaviour. So add this when it's needed:
```
# Sometimes you have to tell it to scroll more, feel free to add another line
        self.driver.execute_script(
            "window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);")
```
If you have to select a date, it's better to type it then click on the select menu for selenium to record it.
6. Make sure the ```test_demo.py``` file name is consistent in the ```getcita.py``` file, as well the function called.
7. In your terminal, run ```python getcita.py``` to start the script.

# Troubleshooting
1. It took me a couple of tries modifying the auto generated code to make it work properly. Often the problem is the scroll down action.
2. The first time I tried to run ChromeDriver, my computer(Mac OS) blocked it. So make sure to unblock it. 
3. That's about it. Feel free to comment and commit. And good luck with your appointment!
